1.Key-Key Value-Value
-------------------
Write a program, which searches for a **key** and **value** inside of several **key-value** pairs.

### Input
-   On the **first** line, you will receive a **key**.
-   On the **second** line, you will receive a **value**.
-   On the **third** line, you will receive **N**.
-   On the next **N** lines, you will receive strings in the following format:

“**key =\> {value 1};{value 2};…{value X}**”

After you receive **N key -\> values** pairs, your task is to go through them
and print **only** the **keys**, which contain the **key** and the **values**,
which contain the **value**. Print them in the following format:  
**{key}**:  
-**{value1}**   
-**{value2}**   
…    
-**{valueN}**     

### Examples
| **Input**                                    | **Output**                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| bug                                          | debug:                                          |
| X                                            | -XUL                                            |
| 3                                            | -XC                                             |
| invalidkey => testval;x;y                    | buggy:                                          |
| debug => XUL;ccx;XC                          | -testX                                          |
| buggy => testX;testY;XtestZ                  | -XtestZ                                         |  



2.Travel Company
--------------
Write a program, which categorizes information about a travel company.

Companies have various vehicles planned for different cities. Every city has prepared several **types of vehicles**. 
Each vehicle type has a different **capacity**.

Until you receive the command “**ready**”, you will receive all the **cities** the company offers holiday packages for, and their respective **vehicle types**+**capacities** in the format:
-   “**{city}:{type}-{capacity},{type}-{capacity}…**”

An example city with its transportation options would look like this:
-   “**Athens:bus-40,airplane-300,train-150**”

If a city is entered a **second time**, add all transport which **hasn’t already been added** and **replace existing** transports’ capacities with the **new** ones.

After the “**ready**” command, you will start receiving **groups** for various cities in the format: “**{city} {peopleCount}**” until you receive “**travel time!**”.

After that, calculate whether the **group** will have **enough seats** to accommodate the passengers and print the status per these conditions:

If the group’s size is **smaller than or equal to** the **combines seats** in all the vehicles, print:
-   “**{city} -\> all {peopleCount} accommodated**”

If the group’s size is **larger than** the **combines seats** in all the vehicles, print:
-   “**{city} -\> all except {peopleCount - transportCapacities} accommodated**”

### Constraints
-   There will be **no redundant whitespaces** anywhere in the input.
-   The input will **always** be in the **format specified**.
-   The **group cities** will **always** be **existing** cities.
-   The **group sizes** will **always** be **positive**.

### Examples
| **Input**                                               | **Output**                                                         |

3.Dict-Ref-Advanced
-----------------
Remember the Dict-Ref Problem from the previous exercise? Well this one is an Advanced Version.

You will begin receiving input lines containing information in one of the following formats:
-   **{key} -\> {value 1, value 2, …, value n}**
-   **{key} -\> {otherKey}**

The **keys** will always be **strings**, and the **values** will always be **integers**, **separated** by a **comma** and a **space**.

If you are **given a key** and **values**, you must **store** the **values** to the **given key**. If the **key** already **exists**, you must **add** the **given values** to the old ones.

If you are **given a key** and **another key**, you must **copy** the **values** of the **other key** to the **first one**. If the **other key does not exist**, this input line must be **IGNORED**.

When you receive the command “**end**”, you must stop reading input lines, and you must print all keys with their values, in the following format:
-   **{key} === {value1, value2, value3...}**

### Examples
| **Input**                                         | **Output**                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Isacc -> 5, 4, 3                                  | Isacc === 5, 4, 3                                     |      
| Peter -> 6, 3, 3                                  | Peter === 6, 3, 3                                     |                
| Derek -> 2, 2, 2                                  | Derek === 2, 2, 2                                     |         
| end                                               |                                                       |   
| **Input**                                         | **Output**                                            |
| Donald -> 2, 2, 2                                 | Donald == 2, 2, 2                                     |      
| Isacc -> 1                                        | Isacc == 1                                            |                
| George -> John                                    | John === 1                                            |    
| John -> Isacc                                     |                                                       | 
| end                                               |                                                       |     



4.Forum Topics
------------
You have been tasked to store a few forum topics, and filter them by several given tags.  
You will be given several input lines, containing data about topics in the following format:
**{topic} -\> {tag1, tag2, tag3...}**

The **topic** and **tags** will be **strings**. They will **NOT** contain **spaces** or ‘**-**’, ‘**\>**’ symbols.

If you receive an **existing topic**, you must **add** the **new tags** to it.
There should be **NO duplicate** tags.

When you receive the command “**filter**”, you must **end** the input sequence.
On the next line (**after** “**filter**”), you will receive a **sequence of tags**, **separated** by a **comma** and a **space**. 
You must print **ONLY** those topics, which **contain all tags** in the **given sequence**.

The topics must be printed in the following format:  
**{topic} \| {\#tag1, \#tag2, …, \#tagN}**

**NOTE:** The tags have a **number sign** (‘**\#**’) as a prefix.

### Examples
| **Input**                                                   | **Output**                                                 |

5.Social Media Posts
----------------------
You have been tasked to create a Console Social Media Database.
You will receive several input lines in one of the following formats:
-   **post {postName}**
-   **like {postName}**
-   **dislike {postName}**
-   **comment {postName} {commenterName} {content}**

If you receive the **post** command, you must **create** a **post** with the **given name**.

If you receive the **like** command you must **add** a **like** to the **given post**.

If you receive the **dislike** command you must add a **dislike** to the **given post**.

If you receive the **comment** command, you must **add** a **comment** to the **given post**. 
The **comment’s writer** must be the **given commentator name**, and the **content** of the **comment** must be the **given content**.

By default, the posts have **0 likes**, **0 dislikes** and **0 comments** when created.

When you receive the command “**drop the media**”, you must end the input sequence, and you must print **every post** with its **likes**, **dislikes** and **comments** in the following format:

**Post: {postName} \| Likes: {likes} \| Dislikes {dislikes}**                                                                            
**Comments:**                                                                                                                             
**\* {commentator1}: {comment1}**                                                                                                        
**\* {commentator2}: {comment2}**                                                                                                         
**. . .**                                                                                                                                

If a certain **post** does **not** have **any** comments, you should just print “**None**”.

The comments have a **prefix** of a **single asterisk** (‘**\***’) and **2 spaces**.

There is **NO space** between the **commentator’s name** and the **colon**.

### Constraints
-   The **post name** will be a **string** of **letters** and **digits**.
-   The **commentator’s name** will be a **string** of **letters**.
-   The comment’s **CONTENT**, may contain **ANY ASCII** character.
-   There will be **NO invalid** input data.

### Examples
| **Input**                                               | **Output**                                                  |
