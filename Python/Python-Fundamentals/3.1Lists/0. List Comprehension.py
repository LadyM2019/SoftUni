    else:
        if v == 2:

Key Points to Remember:
1.List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists.
2.List comprehension is generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.
3.However, we should avoid writing very long list comprehensions in one line to ensure that code is user-friendly.
4.Remember, every list comprehension can be rewritten in for loop, 
but every for loop can’t be rewritten in the form of list comprehension.
5.List comprehensions DO NOT modify the list in-place

"""
Remember that comprehensions are for a single purpose: creating a new iterable from an old iterable, 
while tweaking values slightly along the way and/or for filtering out values that don’t match a certain condition. 
Comprehensions are a lovely tool, but they’re not your only tool. 
Don’t forget the list and dict constructors and always consider for loops when your comprehensions get out of hand.
